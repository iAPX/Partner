# Partner documentation

Partner has been created in 1994, on a 486 DOC PC, to server online players for Minitel service 3615 DIAGO and some others.<br/>
I resurrected it from the dead for modern computers, wether Mac, Raspberry Pi, Android smartphone or even Windows 11 PC!<br/>
And created a Lichess Chess Bot for those that appreciate ugly aand foolish games!
